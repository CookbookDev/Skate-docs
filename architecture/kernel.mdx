  This document requires a prerequisites understanding of the Skate Architecture, you may find it [here](/architecture/skate#skates-kernel-and-periphery)
</Note>

## Kernel Components

The kernel reside on Skate Chain consists of 2 core components:

1. **Message Box**: is a single contract that defines interface for _all Skate Apps_ to register user intent and corresponding execution tasks. It serves as the entry point for creating intents, and all executors will source this contract for pending actions.

1. **Skate App**: is the base contract that all kernel implementations must inherit from. Skate App has the responsbility to: 
    + Defining the interface for executors to reserve execution of intents.
    + Transforming user intents to imperative tasks for executions.
    + Pushing relevant data into Message Box.
    + Link the kernel app to all periphery apps on destination chains.

An overview of the interaction with Kernel are shown in the diagram below:

    intent[User Intents] -- parsed --> processIntent

    subgraph kernel[A Kernel]
      f0[Arbitrary Internal Logics]
      subgraph skateApp[Skate App]
        processIntent["ProcessIntent()"]
      end
      processIntent -- internal call --> f0
    end
    
    processIntent -- external call --> submitTask

    subgraph MB[Message Box]
      submitTask["SubmitTasks()"]
      taskStore[(Task Store)]

      submitTask -- dump --> taskStore
    end
```

In addition, an Executor Registry will live on Skate to register actors with the capability to process user intents. For in-depth details, refer to [execution network](/architecture/execution-network)
