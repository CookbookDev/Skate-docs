Refer to [Stateless App Cookbook#Kernel](/developers/stateless-app-cookbook#kernel).

The intents on EVM chains are EIP191 signed signatures.

To construct the message and validate the signed EVM intent, there are two steps:
    
    1. Get data hash
    ```
    function getDataHashForUser(
        address user,
        address appAddress,
        bytes calldata intentCalldata
    ) public view override returns (bytes memory encodedData) {
        encodedData = abi.encode(
            user,
            _nonce[user],
            appAddress,
            keccak256(bytes(intentCalldata))
        );
    }
    ```
    Perform getDataHashByUser() call on any Stateless app to retrieve data hash. 

    2.  Sign data hash
    For signing, we will be abiding by the [EIP-191] standard(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191). This is supported by popular libraries such as [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage) and wallets. 

Recall the Task structure on Message box,

```solidity IMessageBox.sol
struct Task {
    bytes32 appAddress;
    bytes taskCalldata;
    bytes32 user;
    uint256 chainId;
    uint256 vmType; // 1 = EVM | 2 = TON | 3 = SOLANA | etc..
}
```

After the tasks are created, the serialized EVM message is verified by Skate AVS and then scheduled for execution on EVM periphery contracts.
