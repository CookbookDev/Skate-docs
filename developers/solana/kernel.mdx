title: 'Kernel for Solana'
---

Refer to [Stateless App Cookbook#Kernel](/developers/stateless-app-cookbook#kernel).

The intents on Solana are user signatures over custom messages.

To construct the message and validate the signed Solana intent, Skate VM will implement precompiled op-codes at the chain level, ensuring that the message is correctly structured and the intent is valid for execution.

Recalls the Task structure on Message box

```solidity IMessageBox.sol
struct Task {
    bytes32 appAddress;
    bytes taskCalldata;
    bytes32 user;
    uint256 chainId;
    uint256 vmType; // 1 = EVM | 2 = TON | 3 = SOLANA | etc..
}
```


After the tasks are created, the serialized Solana message is verified by Skate AVS and then scheduled for execution on Solana periphery contracts.
