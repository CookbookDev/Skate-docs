title: 'Sync Wallet across VMs'
---

## Purpose

To facilitate seamless interaction between blockchains operating on different types of Virtual Machines (VMs), Skate employs a central Wallet Registry at the Kernel level. This ensures that users can use various wallets across VMs while maintaining a consistent shared state.

{/* TODO: Include docs for WalletRegistry from Kernel */}

## Interaction flow

The flow for syncing wallets is outlined as follows:

1. Users initiate requests from different virtual machines (VMs).
2. The intents are collected by the Skate Infrastructure, where they are matched through a 2-way handshakeâ€”users must prove ownership of both the VM1 and VM2 wallets to sync them.
3. The executor submits the signature pairs to update the Wallet Registry on the Kernel.

The diagram below illustrates an example interaction between EVM, Solana, and TON. This flow can be generalized to support interactions across N-many VMs.
