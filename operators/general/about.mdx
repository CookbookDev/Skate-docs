title: 'About Skate Preconfirmation AVS'
---

<Note>
  This document is intended for [EigenLayer Operator](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-introduction) and requires understanding of [EigenLayer AVS](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/avs-developer-guide)

  Additionally, a general understanding of [Skate architecture](/main/architecture/skate) is assumed.
</Note>

## Preliminary

Skate Preconfirmation AVS utilizes EigenLayer restaked assets to ensure the economic security of all cross-chain actions. The AVS is responsible for verifying AVS tasks, which are bundled calldata and necessary information for [Skate executors](/main/architecture/execution-network) to settle cross-chain transactions. The AVS verified data output is then signed by the [Skate relayer(/main/architecture/execution-network)] before it is ready to be executed. In other words, Skate AVS pre-confirms data, hence the name Preconfirmation AVS.

## Design

Please refer to the [Skate Preconfirmation AVS](/main/architecture/avs) for a detailed discussion of Skate AVS design.

## Source code

Skate uses [Othentic's stack](/operators/general/othentic), therefore the contracts source code is managed by Othentic.

<Note>
  Currently, Othentic smart contracts is not open to the public. However, general architecture and attestation process can be found in [their docs](https://othentic.gitbook.io/main/stateless-rollup-framework/othentic-consensus/othentic-bls-obls)
</Note>

For off-chain components, we are working on the process to onboard operators. The service code and images will be published in [Skate Github repo](https://github.com/orgs/Skate-Org)

<Note>
  Published images are from our old AVS version. A new version along with updated onboarding docs will be published soon.
</Note>

## Rewards structure

We are working on finalizing the rewards structure. Detailed will be discussed once our PoC for public go live.

## Operator requirements

All Skate AVS operators must be a registered EigenLayer Operator. In addition, the operator need to register to Skate AVS contracts.

The hardware requirements will be dependent on the role of operator. Refers to operator [roles](/operators/roles) section for further details
