### Drawbacks of the current design

While Worldcoinâ€™s current architecture works well in a silo on a single chain, it does not scale well to deploy on multiple chains concurrently:

1. **Duplicated State**<br/>
  Currently, each chain that needs to integrate with World ID needs to copy over the entire merkle tree from Ethereum and maintain a duplicated state
2. **Economic Security of Relayer**<br/>
  The Relayer is a key piece in the architecture whose task is to duplicate the state updates on Ethereum to other chains.  Although the relayer being a criticial component, it is not backed by any economic securities for scenarios where the relayer could turn malicious.

While Worldcoin has been trying to address these issues by launching [their own L2 (WorldChain)](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-chain) and with [Wormhole integration](https://x.com/wormhole/status/1806343150769930320), we believe integration with Skate Chain solves these issues in a much efficient and scalable way. Our integration can focus on enabling Proof of Personhood for TON ecosystem

## Worldcoin integration with Skate

</Frame>

By adopting Skate, WorldCoin can gain the following advantages:


1. **Unified State Management**<br />
    With Skate Chain , the World Identity Manager is deployed as a Kernel Contract which manages a singleton state. The state is accessible via all the integrated contracts

2. **Economic Security via EigenLayer**<br/>
    Skate Chain works as an AVS on EigenLayer, backed by billions of dollars of economic security, which is susceptible to slashing should any component of the chain misbehave.

3. **Scalability to EVM and non-EVM chains**<br/>
    With Skate, the state management is operable across all major L1s and L2, for both EVM and non-EVM. This enables Worldcoin to become universally deployable by just deploying periphery contracts that serve as an interface to interact with the Kernel.
